Strategies for staying top-of-mind with hiring managers
====================================================================================================

Following up after an interview is a crucial step in the job search process. It shows your continued interest in the position, reinforces your qualifications, and helps you stay top-of-mind with hiring managers. In this chapter, we will discuss strategies for following up after an interview.

Timeline for Follow-Up
----------------------

The first step in following up after an interview is to establish a timeline for when to do so. Generally, it's best to follow up within 24-48 hours of the interview to express thanks and reiterate your interest in the position. Another follow-up may be appropriate around 7-10 days after the initial thank-you note to inquire about the status of your application.

Follow-Up Methods
-----------------

There are several methods for following up after an interview:

1. **Thank-You Note:** A thank-you note is a great way to show appreciation for the interviewer's time and reiterate your interest in the position. It should be sent within 24-48 hours of the interview and can be sent via email or traditional mail.

2. **Phone Call:** A phone call is another option for following up after an interview. It allows for more direct communication and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, make sure to respect the interviewer's schedule and avoid calling during business hours.

3. **Email:** Email is a quick and efficient way to follow up after an interview. Keep your message brief and professional, and avoid being too pushy or demanding.

4. **Social Media:** Social media is not typically used for formal follow-up after interviews but can be used for networking and building relationships with industry professionals.

What to Include in Your Follow-Up
---------------------------------

Regardless of the method you choose for following up, there are several key elements to include in your message:

1. **Express Gratitude:** Begin your message by expressing gratitude for the interviewer's time and consideration.

2. **Reiterate Interest:** Reiterate your interest in the position and emphasize why you are a strong fit for the role.

3. **Provide Additional Information:** Provide any additional information that may help reinforce your qualifications, such as relevant experience or education.

4. **Keep it Professional:** Remember to keep your message professional and free of errors or typos.

Following Up with Multiple Interviewers
---------------------------------------

If you interviewed with multiple people, make sure to follow up with each individual separately. Customize your message for each person based on your interactions with them during the interview.

Following up after an interview is an important step in the job search process. It helps you stay top-of-mind with hiring managers and reinforces your qualifications for the position.
